Start with synthesis:
% make synth          # <-- this can take about a minute
% make runtimes       # <-- check how long each step took
% make debug-synth    # <-- bring up synthesis results in the GUI
Continue with place-and-route:
% make signoff        # <-- this can take about ten minutes
% make debug-signoff  # <-- bring up the final layout in the GUI
Run Calibre DRC and LVS:
% make drc            # <-- these can run in parallel with -j
% make lvs            # <-- these can run in parallel with -j

1. flatten hierarchy for possible optimization
# /steps/dc-synthesis/dc.tcl
2. adding input/output delays for each module
# /plugins/dc-synthesis/constraints.tcl
3. change floor plan ratio to fix the error of large amount of IO pins
# /plugins/innovous/always_source.tcl
And change the following parameters:
# core_aspect_ratio
# core_density_target
