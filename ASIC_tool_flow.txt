Start with synthesis:
% make synth          # <-- this can take about a minute
% make runtimes       # <-- check how long each step took
% make debug-synth    # <-- bring up synthesis results in the GUI
Continue with place-and-route:
% make signoff        # <-- this can take about ten minutes
% make debug-signoff  # <-- bring up the final layout in the GUI
Run Calibre DRC and LVS:
% make drc            # <-- these can run in parallel with -j
% make lvs            # <-- these can run in parallel with -j
