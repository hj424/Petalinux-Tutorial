### 1. pass by value, pointer, and reference ###
a. pass by value
void f (int p){
  ...
}
f(a);
b. pass by reference
void f (int &p){
  ...
}
f(a);
*** p has same adderss and value with a
c. pass by pointer
void f (int *p){
  ...
}
f(&a);
*** pointer p point to value a: that is *p=a
d. pass a pointer by reference
void f (int *&p){
  ...
}
*b=&a;
f(b);
*** same pointer p and b
void f (int *p){
  ...
}
*b=&a;
f(b);
*** different pointer p and b, both point to a
