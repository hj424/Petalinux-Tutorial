Python's instance. class, and static methods 

# Inherite attributes from Object
class MyClass(Object):
    def method(self): #1
        return 'instance method called', self

    @classmethod
    def classmethod(cls): #2
        return 'class method called', cls

    @staticmethod
    def staticmethod(): #3
        return 'static method called
   
1. Instance methods can freely access attributes and other methods on the same object
* can modified object state by self.__class__

2. Class methods: takes a cls method that points to the class

3. Static methods: takes neither a self or a cls parameter 
* usually used locally in the mothod
