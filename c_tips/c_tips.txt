# difference among fprintf, printf, and sprintf
fprintf writes formatted text to the output stream you specify.
printf is equivalent to writing fprintf(stdout, ...) and writes formatted text to wherever the standard output stream is currently pointing.
sprintf writes formatted text to an array of char, as opposed to a stream.
