ECB should not be used if encrypting more than one block of data with the same key.

CBC, OFB and CFB are similar, however OFB/CFB is better because you only need encryption and not decryption, which can save code space.

CTR is used if you want good parallelization (ie. speed), instead of CBC/OFB/CFB.

XTS mode is the most common if you are encoding a random accessible data (like a hard disk or RAM).

OCB is by far the best mode, as it allows encryption and authentication in a single pass. However there are patents on it in USA.
